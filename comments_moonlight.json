Why I have to suffer the torture of not see the precious Moon on the Sky? What I have done to deserve this... I just love the ones who love me, take care of ones who care of me, I sang the songs that everyone wanted to hear... Why I'm punish that hard... I'm just a poor lost soul who wants to see the sky... I want to see my child grow, share my life with the one I love, be happy with my fiends, laugh with their jokes... I'm a blinded soul... My eyes don't see anything, my heart beats mechanical in my chest... I want to see Life's eyes, see the Reality's face, see the Night's smile, see the Moonlight's shadow dancing in the grass... I feel so despair, my hands shake constantly, my body can't have no rest... Why..? I have being that bad..? I just wanted to share my love, my joy, my smile...\nOh, Moonlight, shine in this blinded eyes just for once... I want to see your beauty face, your tiny lips, your big nice eyes...\nPlease... I beg you... Don't let me die in this Darkness...\n\n(Despaired Heart - My own strange mind)",

If not pls don't laugh at me I am a music lover and have played piano, violin, viola my entire life, but I have little knowledge of literature/poetry! That was just so touching! Especially having the chance to have your comment be the top as I listened to this piece. I have this piece memorized since I was 7....all three movements. Music I know....literature I wish I knew! I love creative, beautiful minds...i truly believe we are all being called as healers to bring love into this world! I'm a fishy Pisces mind so sorry if this seems silly to turn a compliment/question into a short story here lol but isn't that how we all should learn to be? Love one another by both giving and receiving? Truly, whomever you are (author), pls know you are a gifted old soul that is beautiful and I pray you are blessed and find a way to continue to bring your creative gifts to people in beautiful ways my dear!",

Music breaks me. Music comforts me. As I'm surrounded by people I love, yet I've never felt truly loved myself. Mine has always been a lonely existence. An emotional, tear filled existence. This makes me cry. Seeing a beautiful little girl singing the national anthem makes me cry. Singing certain songs makes me cry. Because I feel every note. I'm not sure I could ever learn to play anything, but I know that whatever I played, would be delivered very emotionally. It would come from my soul. So I know what you mean.",

Is your jealousy so complete that all you can do is attack someone who is clearly capable of Feelings, Emotions and able to share so openly.  Is your need to correct so ingrained that you cannot appreciate genuine passion for what it is without trying to crush someone who clearly is suffering already?Are you one of those that pulls the wings from the Butterfly and Stomps on Ants just to see them die...I think the Pit of Darkness goes even further....Your opinion that most countries Speak English for a reason is very telling. \n\nClearly you believe the English Language so Superior when spoken correctly that anything else is unacceptable even when so genuinely expressed.  Sadly the Real reason English is spoken by so many has not been by choice but due to Pillage...Plundering and Rape :(  All over the World throughout history English has been forced upon many...along with Catholicism....a very Dark time in our History.  I am from Canada and as Canadian as it gets...I do not have my head in the sand...My Eyes are Open and I see what has been done....My Grammar has served me well...but there are many Native Americans who`s languages have been all but obliterated due to genocide through Residential Schools and their forced Proper English.  I only wish I could speak half as fluently as Julio Montes JR in Spanish or any Language....Dark Xectron you are the one who should Hope to see the light.",

HAVE I BEEN SO bad?\nI just wanted to share my love, my joy, my smile.\nOh, Moonlight, shine in THESE blinded eyes just once. \nI want to see your beautIFUL face, your tiny lips, your big nice eyes.\nPlease, I beg you... Don't let me die in this Darkness.",

This song triggers me to victory everytime. TBH This would be at least on my top 10 list. This is just absolutely beautiful. While typing this I relised something. That not You can always fail, but that just makes me tty harder. At school, its hard, I didnt make the basketball team, and its frustrating that I didnt make it. I keep telling to myself that why? WHY DIDNT YOU MAKE??? This haunts me. Scares me. I have to realize that you can't keep thinking about the past, but the future. I really do wanna make the NBA. I really do want to become him... Michael Jordan. But I can't... I can't be him...... But I can be myself and be a better basketball player. Everyday, I go to 24 hour fitness I train as hard as I can. You won't believe me but I stay there for like 8 hrs. In that 8 hrs I only rest 3 times. This is hard. But I always say to myself, If he can do it, Why Not Me? I have been putting that through my thick skull ever since I played basketball. My favorite player is Kobe Bean Bryant. I wish I had all of his signature moves. But I don't. I have to play hard. If something embarrassing happens then I forget. If something happens to me, I keep going like how kobe did with his acl injury. I will always keep going no matter what. I wanna tell you guys this readers. I will become known as the greats. I will be known ass a hall of famer. You guys will watch me and will enjoy it!!!!",

This song helps me calm my thoughts and feelings about this terrible loss. She's not the first baby to go from my life and others have been much closer. But being around Christmas seemed to make it feel a little more sadder somehow. My thoughts and love are with my sister and her husband as it's more there loss and I hope the little cherub is now safe and pain free in a better safer nicer place . Hopefully one day I will see her again ? . Thankyou for this video of this masterpiece it helps me redirect my anger and pain into its correct channels  ; )",

Yes she was a wonderful person, sweet, thoughtful, kind and she had wicked sense of humor. Secondly, 20 years ago I wrote short stories and poetry, mainly as a way of dealing with life both happy times and sad times. All of you who responded to my post with your kind words have awakened my long dormant creative side. Thank you.",

One day she found me in a depressed state because I was having difficulties getting the phrasing and meter correct while learning to play Moonlight Sonata. She put her hand on my shoulder and told me to not worry about perfection just play what I was feeling. She then said, \"You must learn what I have discovered. People with vision often cannot see. They must learn to to hear the sun and sky in the day, and feel the moon and stars at night.\" We were 16 years old. Her words removed my roadblock and even to this day at the age of 68 when I play Moonlight Sonata I hear her words close my eyes and play what I feel and not worry about being perfect. I also cry because this friend died in her 20s as a result of her not seeing an idiot with a gun.",

I get a vision of a very sad 19th century man, sitting in his garret, sipping cognac and crying over a girl, or perhaps his mama. Or many other sad things that we all go through. I cry when one of my relatives or one of my cats leaves me, forever.  I will never see that person or that cat again, ever, in this world at least.",

The affirmations of others need not apply to you or I, and I see that now. Sitting at the edge of the abyss and just thinking kills. But somehow, this piece has brought me back. It has given me purpose. No longer will I strive to put others happiness above my own, but to equalize them both, with my love for music as the spearhead of it all. This song... It's a reassuring darkness. And for this, I thank you.",

The blinding flash that could never now blind him washed over his body that was no longer a body, filling him with a sense of absolution.  He knew he had arrived.  But where?  He did not know...",

I had auditory hallucinations and the only way I was able to calm down enough to sleep sometimes was listening to this on repeat all night. I bought for my old iPod then my phone. This helped and still puts my mind at ease. I can listen to this piece every day for the rest of my life and not get tired of it. I know when I have children this will be one song to help them sleep and calm down.",

Moonlight Sonata will forever hold a place in my heart as the song that ignited my passion for making stories about the songs.",

    "commentText": "I gaze down upon the ground below me and sit on a small ledge near the summit. It's a small mountain I must say, but if I fell from this height, it would surely bring my death. I sigh deeply and think of everything that happened in the year following my father's death. The fights, the neglect, the challenges I faced in primary school. How they've changed me. I let my hair out of it's small messy bun and let the wind blow through it. Tears streak my face. I do not know whether I should be held accountable for the blood on my head if I jump. I take a deep breath and stand up. I look over on the horizon. The sun is starting to creep out from it's hiding place in the sky. \n\n\"Damn,\" I mutter under my breath. I start panicking a bit, being quite irrational in my thoughts. \n\n'Baby, it's okay. I'm here for you. I always will be. Please don't do this..'\n\nI hear Ryan's voice interrupting my thoughts, his British accent standing out like a giraffe in a pig pen. I think of what might happen to him if I jump, if I land on the cold earth and shatter my small frame. I think of how far me and Ryan have come. I sit back down.\n\nI realized in that moment that the sun doesn't leave forever. No, it circles around the earth and rises again in the East. Your actions will do the same, my friends.\n\nI love you Ryan xoxo\n\n(This is somewhat a true story.)",

However, the woman's father did not approve of the choice because he wouldn't allow his daughter to marry anything lower than a rich man who could provide for a family some day. At the time, Beethoven had not yet been discovered by anyone other than Mozart himself. Beethoven had studied for some time with Mozart before he wrote this beautiful piece.",

Why I have to suffer the torture of not see the precious Moon on the Sky? What I have done to deserve this... I just love the ones who love me, take care of ones who care of me, I sang the songs that everyone wanted to hear... Why I'm punish that hard... I'm just a poor lost soul who wants to see the sky... I want to see my child grow, share my life with the one I love, be happy with my fiends, laugh with their jokes... I'm a blinded soul... My eyes don't see anything, my heart beats mechanical in my chest... I want to see Life's eyes, see the Reality's face, see the Night's smile, see the Moonlight's shadow dancing in the grass... I feel so despair, my hands shake constantly, my body can't have no rest... Why..? I have being that bad..? I just wanted to share my love, my joy, my smile...\nOh, Moonlight, shine in this blinded eyes just for once... I want to see your beauty face, your tiny lips, your big nice eyes...\nPlease... I beg you... Don't let me die in this Darkness...\n\n(Despaired Heart - My own strange mind)",

If not pls don't laugh at me I am a music lover and have played piano, violin, viola my entire life, but I have little knowledge of literature/poetry! That was just so touching! Especially having the chance to have your comment be the top as I listened to this piece. I have this piece memorized since I was 7....all three movements. Music I know....literature I wish I knew! I love creative, beautiful minds...i truly believe we are all being called as healers to bring love into this world! I'm a fishy Pisces mind so sorry if this seems silly to turn a compliment/question into a short story here lol but isn't that how we all should learn to be? Love one another by both giving and receiving? Truly, whomever you are (author), pls know you are a gifted old soul that is beautiful and I pray you are blessed and find a way to continue to bring your creative gifts to people in beautiful ways my dear!",

This makes me cry. Seeing a beautiful little girl singing the national anthem makes me cry. Singing certain songs makes me cry. Because I feel every note.

Is your jealousy so complete that all you can do is attack someone who is clearly capable of Feelings, Emotions and able to share so openly.  Is your need to correct so ingrained that you cannot appreciate genuine passion for what it is without trying to crush someone who clearly is suffering already?Are you one of those that pulls the wings from the Butterfly and Stomps on Ants just to see them die...I think the Pit of Darkness goes even further....Your opinion that most countries Speak English for a reason is very telling. \n\nClearly you believe the English Language so Superior when spoken correctly that anything else is unacceptable even when so genuinely expressed.  Sadly the Real reason English is spoken by so many has not been by choice but due to Pillage...Plundering and Rape :(  All over the World throughout history English has been forced upon many...along with Catholicism....a very Dark time in our History.  I am from Canada and as Canadian as it gets...I do not have my head in the sand...My Eyes are Open and I see what has been done....My Grammar has served me well...but there are many Native Americans who`s languages have been all but obliterated due to genocide through Residential Schools and their forced Proper English.  I only wish I could speak half as fluently as Julio Montes JR in Spanish or any Language....Dark Xectron you are the one who should Hope to see the light.",

Corrections are in capital letters.\n\nWhat can I do WITH a lost heart when the light is out? \nWHAT CAN I do when my eyes are missing and I can't see the stars shine? Why MUST I suffer the torture of not seeING the precious Moon IN the Sky? What HAVE I done to deserve this.\nI just WANT TO love the ones who love me, take care of THE ones who TAKE care of me. \nI sang the songs that everyone wanted to hear.\nWhy AM I punishED SO hard.\nI'm just a poor lost soul who wants to see the sky. \nI want to see my child grow, share my life with the one I love, \nbe happy with my FRIENDS, laugh AT their jokes. \nI'm a blinded soul.\n My eyes don't see anything, my heart beats mechanicalLY in my chest. \nI want to see Life's eyes, see Reality's face, see the Night's smile, \nsee the Moonlight's shadow dancing in the grass. \nI feel so MUCH despair, my hands shake constantly, my body CAN HAVE NO rest.\nWhy? HAVE I BEEN SO bad?\nI just wanted to share my love, my joy, my smile.\nOh, Moonlight, shine in THESE blinded eyes just once. \nI want to see your beautIFUL face, your tiny lips, your big nice eyes.\nPlease, I beg you...

    "commentText": "This song is really haunting, but it's haunting in a visceral way. Plenty of songs have spooky minor notes, big deal. But this song is different. The way it walks the line between good and evil. The way the creepiness builds at times, but then pulls back and suddenly, it's trying to make you feel good again, but never failing to make sure you know that darkness is still there. It really is a visceral thing for me. I feel it in my body, in my bones, in my soul, however you wanna say it.",

The yearning of the soul to reach out.  When I was a young boy my brother and I were drowning in a river, our small bodies pressed hard under a fallen tree.  The current was too great for us to swim against.  There in the darkness I could see my father's hand reaching for us.  He grasped my brother first, and pulled him to the surface.  I was stuck further under the body of the tree.  I could see my father's hand desperately reaching for me while he tried to maintain his own grasp.  I reached out, his hand only inches from mine, knowing that he couldn't see me.  As the light faded from my mind, he pulled me to the surface and cast me upon the serpentine branches.  I drew breath.",

    "commentText": "In one evening, late in the night, Mozart was standing in his study room, alone, just relaxing after finishing the last piano lesson with one of his students, when he heard a knock on the door. He opened and saw a young man standing there, dressed in very modest but clean outfit. \n\nThe young man asked Mozart for piano lessons. At the time, Mozart was a very famous composer and piano player. He was also a very generous man. He invited the young man inside and offered to give a free introduction piano lesson. \n\nThe young man smiled a little surprised and immediately accepted. Mozart then asked the young man if he took any piano lessons before. The young man stated that he did learn a little bit on his own. \n\nMozart invited then the young man to play anything, just to evaluate his knowledge. The young man did not have anything prepared. Mozart then said: \"Just improvise something. Anything.\". \n\nThe young man sat in front of the piano, looked at the keys, then looked outside through the open window in the night sky, looked at the full moon a few moments, and then started playing randomly, moving his fingers over the piano keys with ease.\n\nThe improvisation was mostly an arpeggio repetition with different variations, a sad song. Never taking his eyes off the beautiful moon, the young man played with passion, and sadness, a song inspired maybe by the suffering of many years of going to bed hungry in the evenings, and getting off the bed in the mornings with no reason to be either happy or optimist. A sad young life that was going nowhere. A life that will soon be forgotten, a meaningless existence of a meaningless lost soul. \n\nThe song lasted for a good few minutes. The song was beautiful! \n\nMozart was listening, lost in total concentration and admiration. When the young man finished his little improvisation, the silence took over the atmosphere in the room. His eyes were still starring at the moon, embarrassed and afraid to acknowledge the reality of the moment. \n\nMozart was fascinated in admiration. He said to the young man in a deep and smooth voice: \"Maestro, there is nothing I can teach you at this piano!\" ... \n\nThe little song later became pretty much known all around the world. Even hundreds of years later we love to hear it. It is called the \"Moonlight Sonata\". \n\nAnd the young man? His name was Beethoven. \n\nAnd the original name of this piece given by Beethoven was in fact \"Quasi una fantasia\". Just to set the record straight.",

In real life you won't do that. And also, it is a little stupid to criticize a text that according to you, you didn't even read it, isn't it? That is the definition of ignorance, to say the least.

        "commentText": "Ludwig van Beethoven was born in 1770, therefore, he was 14 years younger than Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. During Mozart’s time as a child prodigy, the wife of a valet in Koblenz, Mrs. Van Beethoven, attended one of the concerts of Wolfgang and Nannerl. She was enthralled and had a dream. Should she ever have a child herself, it would be great to see it grow up as a child genius. Her dream was to come true. Ludwig van Beethoven, her son, became one of the greatest composers of his time.\n\nYears later, while Mozart was facing a rough time after his return from Prague and was in dire need of money once again, Ludwig van Beethoven came to Vienna in 1787. He was sixteen and wanted to take lessons from Haydn and Mozart. Who knows what might have happened, had Beethoven’s mother not suddenly fallen ill, forcing him to return to Bonn after just two weeks. Mozart, who was working on “Don Giovanni” and was deeply worried for his fatally ill father, did not receive Beethoven, let alone give him lessons. When Beethoven returned to Vienna much later, Mozart was already dead.",

This amazing piece of music and the truth/myth of Mozart and Beethoven reveal so much thats true about ourselves and what it means to be human.

There were huge binoculars mounted to the deck above the bridge used for watches, 60 feet up from the waterline. Basically 2 mid sized telescopes strapped together. 3 feet long with a 10 inch diameter for each at the big end. You could see the rings of Saturn, the rings of Jupiter, the moons of both, Mars and Venus as well. And a billion stars. The mid watch, midnite to 4am atop the bridge with those glasses on a clear night with the sea rolling under you was as magical a place as any on Earth. God this music and vid takes me back.",

I have listen to it many times, mostly at a quiet level, a few days ago I was listening and heard a bird chirp. At first I thought it was outside my window, but the window is closed because it's winter and there is not a tree close by. I had to tell you that every time I hear the chirp I smile ☺️ it brings me joy. I also pulled up the same sonata that was done by the London Philharmonic and I have to tell you that I enjoy yours so much more. Thank you.",

Rather than using words, Beethoven sat with the young girl at the\npiano and composed Moonlight Sonata. Might Beethoven have felt the rays of\nmoonlight through the window on the keyboard? Was he inspired by the moonlight\ngently resting on the girl’s face? Whatever the motivation, Beethoven set into\nmotion a miracle that freed this young blind girl from the isolation of her\nhome and escorted her through the lighted forest of her thoughts and dreams.",

(She married someone else, which pissed him off somewhat).  \nStill, in dedicating the piece to the countess (can't find any reference to her being blind, though - she was a piano student), the imagery of moonlight came from Ludwig Rellstab, after Beethoven was long dead ...\nHaving said that, though, I reckon the beauty of music is that we can make it mean whatever we want it to mean - whatever we want to associate it with ..... for me it was a brief extramarital affair with a sixteen year old schoolgirl when I was twenty-four ..... bad mistake.",

The time needed to practice the right parts and to gather many instrumentalists together is never given credit... Times don't always change for the better especially in the music industry...

Then I realized my teacher was a money stealing asshole and it wasn’t my hatred for piano, it was my hatred towards my teacher. In a fit of anger and not thinking, i threw my keyboard away and said “I’m never getting lessons again!” now I regret it. Jesus, I want to restart. I’m still in band learning how to play the clarinet, but the piano will always be in my heart. \nHopefully I will get lessons when I am older.

With pop mixed in from all of them. I began to play piano and violin some guitar. And i enjoyed classical music very much as well. Then started to produce music via computer with my midi fighter akai professional ableton setup. Creating melodies bass lines and drum beats high hat rolls etc.   \nComing from a guy who plays piano creates pop and rap beats listens to the Beatles and tupac. And enjoys some good country songs. I can vouch that all music is music and each have there own style and enjoyable factors of them. And its okay for one to like some music and not others. But in fact we should all enjoy music in the way we want to.",

The name \"Moonlight Sonata\" comes from remarks made by the German music critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. Rellstab likened the effect of the first movement to that of moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne.\nIf you listen to the whole 3 movements, you will realize right away that the  third movement doesn't sound like \"Moonlight\" at all.\nBy the way, good morning, Steven!!!",

Drama and the ability to transfuse that into everyone who looks on your tweet, or video, will then be caught in it. In this you can be caught in it, but to most, the simpler way- of just reading and not listening or thinking- is taken, therefore a catchy tune is better than a profound artwork that can be interpreted in hundreds of thousands of ways and can make you feel the emotions of these ways whilst thinking of it.",

If you already feel chills merely listening to it, imagine how it feels actually playing and mastering such a divine composition. It feels totally mind-blowing...\nI recommend you to listen to Chopin and Einaudi if you want to get to know more pieces that trigger chills like this one. My favourite piece in the whole wide world is Burning, by Einaudi. This movement by Beethoven comes right after :P",

Then I'm going to roll my grand piano into the middle of an empty street in a crowded urban residential neighborhood at 3 AM and attach massive speakers to my piano, loud enough to rattle windows all the way down the street. Then I'm going to play moonlight sonata 1st movement all the way through 4 times at full volume. Each time I finish 1 complete version, I am going to light an M80 firecracker on top of my piano. After it explodes, I will repeat the song again until I have played it fully 4 times, no matter what kinds of yells and screams might be directed at me by angry people from their house windows trying to sleep.",

You're a damned fool, just a mouthpiece for demons you don't even know exist, making pronouncements about \"the 1st man on earth\" as though you KNOW anything about IT.

Quickly I start again and again  traveling beyond the realm of logic and possibilities, that rule is not a frame or name to shame but the fame of fire that burns trails like rails through out the Galaxy and to finally  one day out of no where  the Goddess of light spoke to me as I was alone, without fear because of my speed I answered, she asked me if I wanted thunder, the lightting, she stood by myself ever since and lighting is mine because of out darkness I came and lighting was all  I ever needed to complete me.

Light and darkness, that I've  become  perfect, greater knowledge is not without darkness and light.. so was that Lucifer Angel of light, brave at heart took his flight without a fight diving deep into the belly of the beast, that darkness consumed him but he became greater of the two. That love is not a man that measures but the mile the man to measure. That beauty is for the best of measure, that more is the man of mind to find, more is his wait and less is his take, that beauty is one's  to uderstand, like all things. I lifted my wings, one in darkness that i blind the mind and the other of light to blind his sight.",
